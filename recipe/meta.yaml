  summary: 'MetPy is a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing and performing calculations with weather data.'
  description: |
    The space MetPy aims for is GEMPAK (and maybe NCL)-like functionality,
    in a way that plugs easily into the existing scientific Python ecosystem
    (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). So, if you take the average GEMPAK script for
    a weather map, you need to: read data, calculate a derived field, and
    show on a map/skew-T. One of the benefits hoped to achieve over GEMPAK
    is to make it easier to use these routines for any meteorological Python
    application; this means making it easy to pull out the LCL calculation
    and just use that, or re-use the Skew-T with your own data code. MetPy
    also prides itself on being well-documented and well-tested, so that
    on-going maintenance is easily manageable.
